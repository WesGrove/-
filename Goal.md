What do you want by when?
- I am a fluent Mandarin speaker and Chinese reader on a native level asap at latest by December 2026

Why do you want it?
- Gain international perspective
- Activate and develop visually oriented parts of my mind
- Achieve inspiration in new ways
- Expand my world view
- Gain experience to reflect in art & writing
- Have peace in understanding
1. Achieving these things by speaking Mandarin and reading Chinese could help me to end up in situations where perhaps I am creating for an international audience, gaining wisdom I would have otherwise never had, bringing perspective to my local sphere, absorbing learning methods from the country that seems to have the art of learning perfected, opening the door to learning Japanese Mongolian & Tibetan, socializing with like minded people from 中国 zhōngguó, visiting Chinese libraries and reading Chinese books sounds like a dream come true
2. Not achieving these things would lead to a lack of perspective, no ability to expand your local spheres minds, unexplored social paths in life, lack of international understanding, mind not developed to its full potential, harder to even contemplate learning other languages, not being able to read exclusive regional texts, a closed off world view

Who must I become to learn fluent Chinese?
- "I am someone who has full understanding and excellent execution of the Chinese language"

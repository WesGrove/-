Keep in mind as you study Grammar: the meaning translated is often not indicative of how the grammar works in Chinese. When you translate the meaning literally, you get a weird sounding sentence that seems like its ignoring English rules. That is because it is following Mandarin rules, which make up for the discrepancies in rule following that might appear when looking at literal word/sentence meanings in English. Just trust that you will learn the proper rules and that those rules will make the words make sense.

Another tip, words like 吃 (chi1) are defined by me here as "to eat" but that's not to say it literally means the words to eat. 吃 (chi1) is the action of eating, simply put.

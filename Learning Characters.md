From [Mandarin Blueprint's](https://youtube.com/@mandarinblueprint?si=ieRcgZvdKEOLREKh): [How to Master any Chinese Character in Seconds](https://youtu.be/SUVHMEUld4I?si=LQFMcMD7jNMWmJIW)
@pokefound253 Says:
"One thing l've done differently from this method is represent tones with moods:

- 1st tone is a happy or positive mood to the story, 
- 2nd tone is contusion or uncertainty
- 3rd is sadness
- 4th tone is anger or negativity
- 5th tone is bordom or neutrality

For me it makes the scene more memorable and lively when the tone represents emotion instead of location around the place."

# To that End-
-when memorizing characters, you could come up with simple stories for each character in relation to the "mood" of each characters corresponding tone. e.g.,
- 馬 (mă/horse) has the 3rd tone: ˇ
- If that tone is sadness, then you could remember it by thinking, "the horse is sad to be running too fast, he's too tired!"
- Or make it simple, "The horse is sad"

# Living Link
(Mnemonic Association)

1. Identify the word & meaning
2. Create "living link" association (like with a memory)
3. Visualize the association
4. Review & Practice

It is key to do this in Seconds. This should not be too complicated, you're focus is to learn and know
